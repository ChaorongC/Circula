Circula: A all-in-one command-line toolkit for cell-free DNA analysis
===============================================

Circula is a command-line toolkit for cell-free DNA analysis. It is designed to be a one-stop solution for processing cell-free DNA data from raw FASTQ files to machine learning model for disease detection/prediction. Circula is built on top of popular or customized bioinformatics tools such as BWA, trim_galore, and MESA. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple command-line interface that allows users to run the entire analysis pipeline with a single command, or run customized analysis with ease.

Using the example in your own project
-------------------------------------

If you are new to Read the Docs, you may want to refer to the `Read the Docs User documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/>`_.

If you are copying this code in order to get started with your documentation, you need to:

#. place your ``docs/`` folder alongside your Python project. If you are starting a new project, you can adapt the `pyproject.toml` example configuration.
#. use your existing project repository or create a new repository on Github, GitLab, Bitbucket or another host supported by Read the Docs
#. copy ``.readthedocs.yaml`` and the ``docs/`` folder into your project.
#. customize all the files, replacing example contents.
#. add your own Python project, replacing the ``pyproject.toml`` configuration and ``lumache.py`` module.
#. rebuild the documenation locally to see that it works.
#. *finally*, register your project on Read the Docs, see `Importing Your Documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html>`_.


Read the Docs tutorial
----------------------

To get started with Read the Docs, you may also refer to the `Read the Docs tutorial <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/>`__.
It provides a full walk-through of building an example project similar to the one in this repository.
